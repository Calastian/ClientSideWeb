 <h1>Types of bicycles</h1>
 <h2 class="first">Road Bike</h2>
 <p class="road">
 Road bikes are lightweight, high-performance
 bicycles built for speed and efficiency on paved
 surfaces like roads and cycle paths. Key features
 include drop-bar handlebars, skinny 700c wheels
 with smooth tires, a lightweight frame, and a
 wide range of gears for handling varied terrain.
 They are designed for riders who want to cover long
 distances quickly and offer a fast, comfortable,
 and technologically sophisticated riding experience
 </p>
 <h2>Mountain Bike</h2>
 <p class="mountain">
 Mountain bikes, or MTBs, are specialized bicycles
 designed for off-road riding on rough terrain,
 featuring durable frames, knobby tires, and suspension
 systems for shock absorption. Key components include
 powerful brakes (often hydraulic disc brakes), wide
 handlebars for control, and wide-ratio gearing for
 steep climbs and descents. Different types of mountain
 bikes exist, such as cross-country, trail, and downhill,
 each suited for specific terrains and riding styles based
 on factors like suspension travel.
 </p>
 <h2>Gravel Bike</h2>
 <p class="gravel">
 Gravel bikes are versatile bicycles designed to handle
 both paved and unpaved surfaces, blending features of road
 and mountain bikes to offer a comfortable, efficient, and
 capable ride for adventure riding and commuting on mixed
 terrain. Key features include wide tire clearance for
 traction and comfort, a stable and relaxed frame geometry,
 disc brakes for superior stopping power, and often a
 variety of drive-train options for versatility.
